Explore millions of New York City yellow taxi cab trips available in a BigQuery public dataset. Create a machine learning model inside of BigQuery to predict the fare of the cab ride given your model inputs. Lastly evaluate the performance of your model and make predictions.

Objectives

1. Use BigQuery to find public datasets.
2. Query and explore the public taxi cab dataset.
3. Create a training and evaluation dataset to be used for batch prediction.
4. Create a forecasting (linear regression) model in BQML.
5. Evaluate the performance of your machine learning model.
